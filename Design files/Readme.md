Design Files
============================================================

The soil moisture sensors used in this setup have of a ground, supply and signal wire. 
Two of these sensors are connected to a single 4 position header with ground, supply and two signal pins. 
To allow more easy soldering when combining two pairs of three bare wires into a 4-position connector, an aid/connector was designed. 
The folder connector_4x contains the KiCad design files for this aid/connector.
